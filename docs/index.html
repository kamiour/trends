        <h2>
          OpenAI's Turmoil: Sam Altman's Abrupt Exit and the Ensuing Corporate
          Drama
        </h2>
        <p class="news-date">Date: 2023-11-21</p>
        <p class="news-preview">
          In an unexpected turn of events, OpenAI, the renowned AI research lab,
          faced a major upheaval on November 21, 2023, as CEO Sam Altman was
          abruptly dismissed. The decision, taken by four board members, was
          shrouded in mystery, with no clear reasons given. This sudden move
          sparked a wave of resignations, including OpenAI chair Greg Brockman,
          and senior executives Jakub Pachocki, Aleksander Madry, and Szymon
          Sidor. The tech community, including luminaries like Eric Schmidt and
          Brian Chesky, rallied in support of Altman, with major investors
          advocating for his reinstatement. The company appointed Mira Murati as
          interim CEO, only to replace her within days with Twitch co-founder
          Emmett Shear, marking the third CEO change in a brief span. Microsoft
          swiftly hired both Altman and Brockman for AI initiatives. Almost 500
          OpenAI employees threatened to quit, demanding the reinstatement of
          Altman and Brockman. This corporate drama at OpenAI seems to stem from
          deep-seated conflicts between its for-profit and non-profit visions,
          with Altman favoring a more aggressive approach contrary to the
          cautious stance on AI's ethical risks preferred by the non-profit
          side​​​​​​​​...

        <h2>
          Steelers Dismiss Offensive Coordinator Matt Canada Amid Season
          Struggles
        </h2>
        <p class="news-date">Date: 2023-11-21</p>
        <p class="news-preview">
          On November 21, 2023, the Pittsburgh Steelers made a significant move
          by firing their offensive coordinator Matt Canada. Coach Mike Tomlin
          announced the decision, highlighting the team's struggle with one of
          the NFL's worst offenses. The Steelers' performance under Canada's
          guidance was lackluster, marked by scoring the fifth-fewest points and
          amassing minimal yardage. Despite a promising start in 2020 as
          quarterbacks coach and subsequent promotion to offensive coordinator
          in 2021, Canada's tenure saw the team's offense stagnate. The Steelers
          ranked poorly in both yards and points during his time, with a notable
          decline in their passing attack. This season, rookie quarterback Kenny
          Pickett, despite being a high draft pick, could not uplift the team's
          performance. The Steelers' next challenge is a game against the
          Cincinnati Bengals, with hopes to turn their season around
          post-Canada's exit​​​​...

          Brazil vs Argentina: Intense Rivalry Resumes at Maracana in 2026 World
          Cup Qualifiers
        </h2>
        <p class="news-date">Date: 2023-11-21</p>
        <p class="news-preview">
          A highly anticipated match in the FIFA World Cup 2026 Qualifiers saw
          Brazil and Argentina face off at the iconic Maracana Stadium. Coming
          off defeats in their previous games, both teams were eager to return
          to winning ways. Brazil, under Fernando Diniz, had a challenging run
          in the qualifiers, securing only two wins in five games and suffering
          a significant loss against Colombia. The team's woes were compounded
          by the injury of star player Vinicius Junior. Argentina, led by Lionel
          Scaloni, also faced a setback with a loss to Uruguay but remained at
          the top of the standings. The historical rivalry between these two
          South American giants added a layer of intensity to the match. Despite
          both teams possessing strong offensive capabilities, recent encounters
          have been low-scoring affairs. This match was no different, with The
          Hard Tackle predicting a narrow 1-0 victory for Argentina,
          capitalizing on Brazil's current struggles in the qualifiers​​.​...

        <p class="news-date">Date: 2023-11-21</p>
        <p class="news-preview">
          Super Bowl LVII marked a historic moment as it featured the first NFL
          showdown between brothers Travis and Jason Kelce. Post the game,
          emotions ran high for both, with Jason's Philadelphia Eagles narrowly
          losing to Travis' Kansas City Chiefs in a close 38-35 match. The
          emotional impact was palpable during their podcast, "New Heights,"
          where they discussed the game's aftermath. Jason Kelce, at 35,
          remained undecided about his future in the NFL, expressing his
          exhaustion and the need to recharge before making any decisions. He
          spoke of the joy of experiencing the Super Bowl with his brother and
          the pride in his team's efforts, despite the loss. Meanwhile, Travis
